You are given array of integers, your task will be to count all pairs in that array and return their count.
Notes:
Array can be empty or contain only one value; in this case return 0
Random tests: maximum array length is 1000, range of values in array is between 0 and 1000
Examples
[1, 2, 5, 6, 5, 2]  -->  2
...because there are 2 pairs: 2 and 5
[1, 2, 2, 20, 6, 20, 2, 6, 2]  -->  4
...because there are 4 pairs: 2, 20, 6 and 2 (again)

we create a new array - for each number we check if that number is in the array
if not we put in in there, if it is we remove it and count a pair */

function duplicates(array) {
	let double = []
	let pairs = 0
	for (let number of array) {
		if (double[number] != number) {
			double[numbe] = number
		} else {
			double[number] = undefined
			pairs++
		}
	}
	return pairs
}
